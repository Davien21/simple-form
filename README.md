2. Create a new branch from the master branch using your name as its title  
For example **Chidi** can be the name for my own branch   

3. Write some code while you are checked out into this new branch   

4. Add, commit and push the code to github with this code format:   
```git push -u origin [your-branch-name]```

5. Wait for me to review your code and merge into the master branch


### IMPORTANT
1. Before your do a commit or push, you will see the branch you are currently on via the terminal
2. After I review your code, I may make comments on it, especially if there's a small issue.
You may get email notifications about them, but it's better to watch the repo to see any updates or notifications
